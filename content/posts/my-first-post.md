# Here we go, trying out a phat main heading

## And a sub-heading, would you look at that!

This should then be some regular copy in true markdown fashion. I assume at least, it's all a bit new to me. Well, not writing markdown, per se, but this way of creating static site content for a SSG like Hugo. In any case, I think the process of getting Hugo up-and-running on my Linux system was pretty easy. Even with Chocolatey on Windows it was very straight forward.

## Stop! Table time!

Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 4 | Heading 5 | Wait, where's heading 3?
